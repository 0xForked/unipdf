# UniDoc

[UniDoc](http://unidoc.io) is a fast and powerful package for document manipulation starting off as a PDF
toolkit. This is a commercial library written and supported by the owners
of the FoxyUtils.com website.

This library is used to power many of the services offered by the FoxyUtils.com website. The goal is to extend it to
eventually support all of the offered services.
